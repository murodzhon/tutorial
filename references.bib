abstract = {It is well known that older people are more susceptible to morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, particularly from pulmonary diseases such as pneumococcal pneumonia where vaccines do not provide efficient protection as in younger populations. We have previously shown that the B-cell repertoire in the old is reduced and hypothesise that this may contribute to the impaired humoral responses of the elderly. Here, we investigated the repertoire and antibody responses to winter vaccination in two age groups, aged 18-49 and 65-89. We found that the serum IgM and IgA pneumococcal responses were significantly impaired in the older group, with no difference in IgG levels. IGHM spectratype analysis seems to be the most promising in terms of its predictive ability for vaccine responses. Spectratypes showed a clear change in the repertoire at day 7 after vaccination, with a return to the baseline levels at day 28. The changes at day 7 reflected expansion of IGH sequences that have smaller, more hydrophilic, CDR3 regions, and these changes were attenuated in the older group. The older group was more likely to have spectratypes indicative of a reduced diversity at day 0 and day 28. On average, the baseline repertoire in the older group was comprised of larger CDR3 regions than in the younger group. In conclusion, IgA and IgM responses are significantly impaired in the elderly pneumococcal response and are likely key mediators of protection. Hydrophilicity and/or small size of the IGH CDR3 appear to be important in these responses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clonal expansion of B lymphocytes coupled with somatic mutation and antigen selection allow the mammalian humoral immune system to generate highly specific immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies against invading bacteria, viruses and toxins. The availability of high-throughput DNA sequencing methods is providing new avenues for studying this clonal expansion and identifying the factors guiding the generation of antibodies. The identification of groups of rearranged immunoglobulin gene sequences descended from the same rearrangement (clonally-related sets) in very large sets of sequences is facilitated by the availability of immunoglobulin gene sequence alignment and partitioning software that can accurately predict component germline gene, but has required painstaking visual inspection and analysis of sequences.

RESULTS: We have developed and implemented an algorithm for identifying sets of clonally-related sequences in large human immunoglobulin heavy chain gene variable region sequence sets. The program processes sequences that have been partitioned using iHMMune-align, and uses pairwise comparisons of CDR3 sequences and similarity in IGHV and IGHJ germline gene assignments to construct a distance matrix. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering is then used to identify likely groups of clonally-related sequences. The program is available for download from http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/\~{}ihmmune/ClonalRelate/ClonalRelate.zip.

CONCLUSIONS: The method was evaluated on several benchmark datasets and provided a more accurate and considerably faster identification of clonally-related immunoglobulin gene sequences than visual inspection by domain experts.},

@article{Shapiro1999,
abstract = {Somatic mutations are not distributed randomly throughout Ab V region genes. A sequence-specific target bias is revealed by a defined hierarchy of mutability among di- and trinucleotide sequences located within Ig intronic DNA. Here we report that the di- and trinucleotide mutability preference pattern is shared by mouse intronic JH and Jkappa clusters and by human VH genes, suggesting that a common mutation mechanism exists for all Ig V genes of both species. Using di- and trinucleotide target preferences, we performed a comprehensive analysis of human and murine germline V genes to predict regional mutabilities. Heavy chain genes of both species exhibit indistinguishable patterns in which complementarity-determining region 1 (CDR1), CDR2, and framework region 3 (FR3) are predicted to be more mutable than FR1 and FR2. This prediction is borne out by empirical mutation data from nonproductively rearranged human VH genes. Analysis of light chain genes in both species also revealed a common, but unexpected, pattern in which FR2 is predicted to be highly mutable. While our analyses of nonfunctional Ig genes accurately predicts regional mutation preferences in VH genes, observed relative mutability differences between regions are more extreme than expected. This cannot be readily accounted for by nascent mRNA secondary structure or by a supplemental gene conversion mechanism that might favor nucleotide replacements in CDR. Collectively, our data support the concept of a common mutation mechanism for heavy and light chain genes of mice and humans with regional bias that is qualitatively, but not quantitatively, accounted for by short nucleotide sequence composition.},

@article{Stern2014,
abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by autoimmune-mediated demyelination and neurodegeneration. The CNS of patients with MS harbors expanded clones of antigen-experienced B cells that reside in distinct compartments including the meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and parenchyma. It is not understood whether this immune infiltrate initiates its development in the CNS or in peripheral tissues. B cells in the CSF can exchange with those in peripheral blood, implying that CNS B cells may have access to lymphoid tissue that may be the specific compartment(s) in which CNS-resident B cells encounter antigen and experience affinity maturation. Paired tissues were used to determine whether the B cells that populate the CNS mature in the draining cervical lymph nodes (CLNs). High-throughput sequencing of the antibody repertoire demonstrated that clonally expanded B cells were present in both compartments. Founding members of clones were more often found in the draining CLNs. More mature clonal members derived from these founders were observed in the draining CLNs and also in the CNS, including lesions. These data provide new evidence that B cells traffic freely across the tissue barrier, with the majority of B cell maturation occurring outside of the CNS in the secondary lymphoid tissue. Our study may aid in further defining the mechanisms of immunomodulatory therapies that either deplete circulating B cells or affect the intrathecal B cell compartment by inhibiting lymphocyte transmigration into the CNS.},

abstract = {Analyses of somatic hypermutation (SHM) patterns in B cell immunoglobulin (Ig) sequences contribute to our basic understanding of adaptive immunity, and have broad applications not only for understanding the immune response to pathogens, but also to determining the role of SHM in autoimmunity and B cell cancers. Although stochastic, SHM displays intrinsic biases that can confound statistical analysis, especially when combined with the particular codon usage and base composition in Ig sequences. Analysis of B cell clonal expansion, diversification, and selection processes thus critically depends on an accurate background model for SHM micro-sequence targeting (i.e., hot/cold-spots) and nucleotide substitution. Existing models are based on small numbers of sequences/mutations, in part because they depend on data from non-coding regions or non-functional sequences to remove the confounding influences of selection. Here, we combine high-throughput Ig sequencing with new computational analysis methods to produce improved models of SHM targeting and substitution that are based only on synonymous mutations, and are thus independent of selection. The resulting "S5F" models are based on 806,860 Synonymous mutations in 5-mer motifs from 1,145,182 Functional sequences and account for dependencies on the adjacent four nucleotides (two bases upstream and downstream of the mutation). The estimated profiles can explain almost half of the variance in observed mutation patterns, and clearly show that both mutation targeting and substitution are significantly influenced by neighboring bases. While mutability and substitution profiles were highly conserved across individuals, the variability across motifs was found to be much larger than previously estimated. The model and method source code are made available at http://clip.med.yale.edu/SHM.},

abstract = {Analyses of somatic hypermutation (SHM) patterns in B cell Ig sequences have important basic science and clinical applications, but they are often confounded by the intrinsic biases of SHM targeting on specific DNA motifs (i.e., hot and cold spots). Modeling these biases has been hindered by the difficulty in identifying mutated Ig sequences in vivo in the absence of selection pressures, which skew the observed mutation patterns. To generate a large number of unselected mutations, we immunized B1-8 H chain transgenic mice with nitrophenyl to stimulate nitrophenyl-specific $\lambda$+ germinal center B cells and sequenced the unexpressed $\kappa$ L chains using next-generation methods. Most of these $\kappa$ sequences had out-of-frame junctions and were presumably uninfluenced by selection. Despite being nonfunctionally rearranged, they were targeted by SHM and displayed a higher mutation frequency than functional sequences. We used 39,173 mutations to construct a quantitative SHM targeting model. The model showed targeting biases that were consistent with classic hot and cold spots, yet revealed additional highly mutable motifs. We observed comparable targeting for functional and nonfunctional sequences, suggesting similar biological processes operate at both loci. However, we observed species- and chain-specific targeting patterns, demonstrating the need for multiple SHM targeting models. Interestingly, the targeting of C/G bases and the frequency of transition mutations at C/G bases was higher in mice compared with humans, suggesting lower levels of DNA repair activity in mice. Our models of SHM targeting provide insights into the SHM process and support future analyses of mutation patterns.},
